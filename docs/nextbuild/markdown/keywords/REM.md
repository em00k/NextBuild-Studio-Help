# REM

## Syntax

```
REM *var or array_elem*[, *var or array_elem*, *var or array_elem*...]
```

## Description

Traditional BASIC dialects (e.g. Sinclair BASIC) uses REM to comment lines. REM is an abbreviation of REMark. ZX BASIC allows it. Newer dialects uses the apostrophe character (') as a shortened REM. ZX BASIC also allows it, so the above listing could be also rewritten this way:

**Example**

	' This line has a comment

	20 PRINT "Hello World": 'The following sentence is ignored: PRINT "Hello Again"
